Good news! I have coded up a GUI for the parser. Enjoy the glorious graphical interface.

The Ad_Adjuster can not only delete all timestamps during the ad and merge the sections to a coherent whole again, it can also insert ads at any given point if the need for that should ever arise. It will automatically adjust all affected timestamps accordingly.

I hope these are useful and usable. Have fun!
